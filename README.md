# Project-Quantum-1
Successfully tested multiplayer online platformer. You control a rectangle that can jump around a level made of square tiles along with other players. A friend programmed the level editor.

client code - client0.6.py  
server code - linux-server/Project_Quantum_Server.py  
physics engine (collision detection between player and tile) - linux-server/collidePlayer.py (this will need to be re-compiled for your system using cython.)
